# System-Profiler
A C++ application that monitors and displays key system metrics including CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and active processes. Utilizes fork() and inter-process communication (IPC) to delegate different monitoring tasks to separate processes, improving resource management, responsiveness, and system efficiency.
